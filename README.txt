Create a .json file, e.g.:
./data/or_gate.json

Then run it as a neural net:
./bin/neural_net.rb ./data/or_gate.json

# FIXME:
  update input to be closer to output, i.e.:
  ./output/initial_unbiased_or_gate.json

  # include (optional) connections & weights
  # that way a trained net can be saved and restored for use later...
